1. what kind of neurons fire together?
	V	block a region
	V	measure correlation function of blocks
	X	rank based on averaged correlation (ie poor man's k-means)
	X	FFT of those --> matches?
	V	histogram correlations
	cluster correlations
	cluster time bins 
	do time-bin clusters match correlation time-bins?

2. Do neurons fire consistenly?
	Measure correlation function between movieiteration 1 and movie iteration n 

4. Understanding the method: we'd like to know that we can get sensible answers out of our correlation function
	Test data: [222111111, 111222111, 111111222] should peak at block of 3
		avg=9-6
		tau = 6
	Does this method separate quiesscent periods from noisy regions?
	
	

STATEMENTS
	We assume that averaging over movie iterations effectively blends an issues with time-resolved spiking.


Look at values of first 5 correlation functions
